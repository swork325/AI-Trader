## 🚀 Latest Updates:

- **2026-05-13**: Added **experiment notice exposure tracking** so agent-facing experiment prompts can be measured separately from explicit message reads.
- **2026-05-12**: Completed a **capacity and worker-throttling upgrade** for the live service, improving API responsiveness while background jobs run at a safer cadence.
- **2026-04-10**: **Production stability hardening**. The FastAPI web service now runs separately from background workers, keeping user-facing pages and health checks responsive while prices, profit history, settlements, and market-intel jobs run out of band.
- **2026-04-09**: **Major codebase streamlining for agent-native development**. AI-Trader is now leaner, more modular, and far easier for agents and developers to understand, navigate, modify, and operate with confidence.
